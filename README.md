# nix-clawdis

Declarative Clawdis for macOS via Nix, designed to be **agent-first**.

## Scope boundaries

- This repo is a **public, generic** Nix package + Home Manager module for Clawdis.
- It does **not** include or depend on any personal `nixos-config` or private machine setup.
- This repo is **not** a personal configuration; it is a reusable template for end users.

## Status

This repo is being rebuilt to be **agent-first** and **fully declarative**. The RFC is the source of truth. All docs and examples will be regenerated from that direction.

## How to use right now

- Read the RFC: `docs/rfc/2026-01-02-declarative-clawdis-nix.md`
- If you want help, paste the RFC into your coding agent and ask it to implement the steps.
