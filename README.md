# nix-clawdis

Declarative Clawdis for macOS via Nix, designed to be **agent‑first**.

## Scope boundaries

- This repo is a **public, generic** Nix package + Home Manager module for Clawdis.
- It does **not** include or depend on any personal `nixos-config` or private machine setup.

## Start here

- Agent‑First Guide: `docs/agent-first.md`
- Operator Reference: `docs/operator-reference.md`
- RFC: `docs/rfc/2026-01-02-declarative-clawdis-nix.md`

## Status

This repo is being rebuilt to be fully declarative and agent‑first. The RFC is the source of truth.
